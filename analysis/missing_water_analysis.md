## 1. Overview

*The Case of the Missing Water* is a STEAM-themed Indian picturebook published on StoryWeaver, Pratham Books' open-access multilingual digital archive. The narrative follows Ranj, a school-going girl with a detective's disposition, as she investigates the disappearance of water from her village's water supply. Accompanied by her friend Sapna — an aspiring sanitation engineer — Ranj traces the problem upstream and downstream before discovering that a man has been illegally diverting water from the village bund via pipes, prioritising urban water needs over rural access. The story resolves when the monsoon arrives, the bund overflows, and the village's water supply is restored.

The book operates simultaneously as environmental science narrative, problem-solving adventure, and implicit commentary on gendered agency, rural-urban water inequity, and community knowledge systems.

## 2. Gender Representation

### 2.1 Female Agency and STEAM Identity

Ranj is constructed as an active, intellectually curious protagonist whose detective methodology — observation, hypothesis, field investigation — mirrors scientific inquiry. Her problem-solving is systematic: she checks upstream, downstream, and across the landscape before arriving at a conclusion grounded in evidence rather than assumption. This positions her firmly within STEAM discourse as a practitioner of empirical reasoning, not merely a recipient of scientific knowledge.

Sapna's identity as an aspiring sanitation engineer is significant. Engineering — and sanitation engineering in particular — is a field historically underrepresented by women in South Asian contexts. Her ambition is presented without irony or qualification, normalising female professional aspiration in a STEM field with direct community impact.

### 2.2 Male Authority and Resource Control

The antagonist — the man controlling the water diversion — occupies a position of infrastructural authority. He controls access to a shared resource (the bund) and exercises this control on behalf of urban interests, framing rural water access as secondary. His authority is spatial (he controls the pipes and the bund) and ideological (he determines whose water needs are legitimate). This dynamic encodes a gendered and urban-rural power asymmetry that the narrative ultimately disrupts — though resolution comes through natural intervention (the monsoon) rather than through the girls' direct confrontation alone.

### 2.3 Intergenerational Female Knowledge

The visual presence of an elderly woman figure (visible in the illustration) — commanding, positioned elevated on a rock, directing attention — suggests the presence of intergenerational female authority within the community. This figure represents embodied, place-based knowledge that exists alongside Ranj's more formally scientific approach, suggesting the text values multiple epistemologies rather than privileging Western scientific rationality exclusively.

## 3. STEAM Themes

| Theme | Manifestation in Text |
|---|---|
| **Science** | Empirical investigation: Ranj observes, hypothesises, tests |
| **Technology** | Pipe diversion infrastructure; the bund as water management technology |
| **Engineering** | Sapna's identity as aspiring sanitation engineer |
| **Environment** | Drought, water scarcity, monsoon ecology, rural water systems |
| **Mathematics** | Implicit in upstream/downstream reasoning and water flow logic |

The text integrates STEAM not as curriculum content but as lived practice — children doing science in their own environment, using community knowledge and physical investigation rather than classroom tools.

## 4. Multimodal Analysis

### 4.1 Visual Style
The illustration style is expressive and dynamic — characters are rendered with strong gestural lines, warm earth tones dominating the palette (cracked dry land, brown goats, dusty landscapes), contrasted with Ranj's bright orange clothing and green accessories. This colour contrast visually codes Ranj as an active, energetic presence against an environment defined by scarcity and aridity.

### 4.2 Page Composition and Power
The image analysed shows a strong compositional power dynamic: the elderly woman occupies an elevated position (on a rock, physically dominant), holding a staff, pointing — gestures of authority and direction. Ranj stands at ground level, smaller in frame, holding a notebook — the tools of inquiry rather than command. This spatial encoding reinforces the coexistence of directive authority (elder) and investigative agency (child) within female characters.

### 4.3 Text-Image Relationship
The relationship between text and image in the StoryWeaver edition is complementary rather than redundant — images extend narrative information (showing environmental context, character expression, spatial relationships) that the text does not explicitly state. This multimodal layering rewards close reading of both channels simultaneously.

## 5. Positioning within the StoryWeaver Archive

StoryWeaver is one of the most significant open-access multilingual children's literature archives produced from the Global South, with over 50,000 stories in 300+ languages. *The Case of the Missing Water* exemplifies a strand of content that foregrounds:

- **Female protagonists in STEAM roles** — counter to dominant global picturebook trends
- **Rural South Asian environmental contexts** — underrepresented in global children's publishing
- **Community-based problem solving** — as distinct from individualist Western STEM narratives
- **Open licensing (CC BY 4.0)** — enabling reuse, translation, and computational analysis

This makes the StoryWeaver archive a particularly productive site for digital humanities research into gender, STEAM, and Global South representation in children's literature — which was the central focus of the TU Darmstadt fellowship project.

## 6. Methodological Note

This analysis applies a multimodal analytical framework drawing on Gunther Kress and Theo van Leeuwen's social semiotic approach to visual communication, combined with feminist content analysis of gender representation in children's literature. The coding framework used in the accompanying dataset (`analysis_dataset.csv`) was developed to enable systematic comparison across multiple picturebook texts in the StoryWeaver archive.
