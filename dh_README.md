## Project Overview

This repository documents research into gender representation and STEAM themes
in open-access multilingual picturebook archives from the Global South,
with a focus on the StoryWeaver digital archive (Pratham Books, India).

The project applies multimodal analytical frameworks to picturebook texts,
combining feminist content analysis with digital humanities methods to
examine how gender and STEAM identities are constructed and encoded in
children's literature produced outside dominant Euro-American publishing contexts.
