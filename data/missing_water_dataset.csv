GENDER,Protagonist gender,Female,Ranj is a girl,Primary protagonist
GENDER,Antagonist gender,Male,Man controlling water diversion,Controls institutional resource
GENDER,Secondary character gender,Female,Sapna: aspiring sanitation engineer,Active role
GENDER,Elder figure gender,Female,Goatherd/elder woman in illustration,Authority figure
GENDER,Female agency,High,Ranj investigates independently; Sapna has professional aspirations,Both girls are active not passive
GENDER,Male authority type,Institutional/infrastructural,Controls bund diversion; prioritises urban over rural,Power over shared resource
GENDER,Gender balance overall,Female-dominant,Majority of named characters are female,Unusual in global picturebook context
STEAM,Science,Present,Empirical observation and hypothesis testing by Ranj,Scientific method modelled
STEAM,Technology,Present,Pipe diversion infrastructure; bund as water technology,Both appropriate and misused tech shown
STEAM,Engineering,Present,Sapna identified as aspiring sanitation engineer,Female engineering identity normalised
STEAM,Environment,Present,Drought; water scarcity; monsoon ecology; rural water systems,Central to plot
STEAM,Mathematics,Implicit,Upstream/downstream reasoning; water flow logic,Not foregrounded but present
STEAM,STEAM integration type,Lived practice,Children do science in community context not classroom,Distinct from curriculum-based STEAM narratives
VISUAL,Colour palette,Warm earth tones dominant,Cracked land; brown goats; dusty landscape,Aridity coded visually
VISUAL,Protagonist colour coding,High contrast,Ranj in bright orange and green against muted background,Visual agency signalled through colour
VISUAL,Compositional power,Vertical hierarchy,Elder woman elevated on rock; Ranj at ground level,Authority vs inquiry spatially encoded
